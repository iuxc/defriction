# defriction — Homepage Copy & Structure

---

## 1. HERO

**Layout:** Keep current layout. Badge above headline, headline, subhead, two CTAs.

**Badge:**  
`OVERNIGHT UX OVERFLOW`

**Headline:**  
Send a Problem. Sleep on It. Literally.

**Subhead:**  
Overflow for agencies. Firepower for startups. Senior UX work from a designer who runs with the brief.

**CTAs:**  
- `See the Work` → scrolls to Work section  
- `Book a Call` → Calendly link (or scroll to contact)

---

## 2. CREDIBILITY BAR (NEW)

**Layout:** Simple horizontal strip below hero. 3-4 stats or proof points. Subtle, not shouty.

**Content:**

| 20+ years | Prototypes, not PDFs | 2-3 partners at a time | Booking for March |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|

*Alternative: Replace "Booking for March" with a recognizable client logo strip if you have permission.*

---

## 3. THE PROBLEM (NEW)

**Layout:** Short text block, centered. Sets up why they need this.

**Headline:**  
Your team's at capacity. The deadline isn't moving.

**Body:**  
You need senior UX work without the onboarding, the check-ins, or the hand-holding. You need someone who gets the brief, gets to work, and gets it done.

That's what defriction is for.

---

## 4. SELECTED WORK

**Layout:** Keep current. Three case study cards.

**Section badge:**  
`THE WORK`

**Headline:**  
Selected Work

**Subhead:**  
Complex problems, solved. Friction, removed.

*Case study cards remain as-is—Monash University, BOM, Internal Tools.*

---

## 5. WHY ME (REPLACES "THE METHOD")

**Layout:** Three cards/columns, each with an icon, headline, and short paragraph. Clean and scannable.

**Section badge:**  
`WHY IT WORKS`

**Headline:**  
Built for agencies who can't babysit.

---

### Card 1: Self-Directed

**Headline:**  
No hand-holding required.

**Body:**  
Send the brief. I'll ask smart questions, then disappear into the work. You'll get a working prototype—not a deck of questions.

---

### Card 2: Timezone Advantage

**Headline:**  
Your overnight is my workday.

**Body:**  
Brief me at end of day. Wake up to progress. The 15-hour timezone gap means you get design work done while your team sleeps.

---

### Card 3: Designs That Ship

**Headline:**  
I know what actually gets built.

**Body:**  
20 years in enterprise, government, and higher ed taught me what survives the stakeholder gauntlet. I design for sign-off, not just aesthetics. And I know what's feasible for your dev team.

---

## 6. ABOUT

**Layout:** Keep current split layout (text left, photo right). Tighten copy.

**Section badge:**  
`ABOUT`

**Headline:**  
The Executive Who Designs.

**Body:**  
I'm Brian. By day, I lead Digital Strategy for the University of Oregon—web governance, UX, content, the works.

defriction is where I get back to the craft: solving high-stakes design problems with the perspective of someone who's sat in the rooms where work gets approved or killed.

**Stats row:**

| Based in | Experience | Day job |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Eugene, OR (PST) | 20+ years | AVP, Digital Strategy |

**Link:**  
`View Full Profile →` *(optional—only if you have a longer bio page)*

---

## 7. TESTIMONIAL (NEW)

**Layout:** Single quote, centered. Keep it simple—no carousel. One strong quote beats three weak ones.

**Quote:**  
"[Testimonial copy here—ideally something that speaks to self-direction, speed, or quality of thinking.]"

**Attribution:**  
— Name, Title, Company

*If you have two strong quotes, stack them vertically. No more than two.*

---

## 8. CONTACT

**Layout:** Keep current form layout. Add Calendly option.

**Headline:**  
Let's remove the friction.

**Subhead:**  
Tell me what you're working on—or book a call if you'd rather talk it through.

**Form fields:**
- Name  
- Email  
- Project type (dropdown: Overflow / New project / Retainer / Not sure)  
- The brief (textarea): "What challenge are you trying to solve?"

**CTA button:**  
`Start the Conversation`

**Below form:**  
`Or book a call directly →` (link to Calendly)

---

## 9. FOOTER

**Layout:** Keep minimal. Logo, nav links, contact email, maybe LinkedIn icon.

---

# Notes

- **Tone:** Direct, confident, no fluff. You're a senior operator, not a freelancer begging for work.
- **Audiences:** Copy works for both agencies and startups. Case studies can do the targeting.
- **"defriction" as concept:** Used lightly in contact section ("remove the friction") without overdoing it.
- **Urgency:** "Booking for March" and "2-3 partners at a time" create scarcity without being pushy.

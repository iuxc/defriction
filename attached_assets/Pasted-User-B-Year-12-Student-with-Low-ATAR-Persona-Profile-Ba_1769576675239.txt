User B: Year 12 Student with Low ATAR
Persona Profile

Background: Victorian Year 12 student.

ATAR: 60.00 (below typical direct entry requirements).

Goal: Find a pathway to a Monash degree via a Monash College diploma.

Journey Steps & Observations

Step 1: Monash University Homepage

Finding: User arrives looking for information on alternative entry methods.

Observation: The site provides a standard entry point for all prospective domestic students.

Step 2: Pathway Information Search

Finding: User attempts to navigate to specialized pathway pages via the "Study" menu.

Friction: Broken Links. Multiple 404 errors were encountered when trying to access /study/how-to-apply/pathways, forcing a return to Google.

Step 3: Entry Pathways for Domestic Students Page

Finding: A landing page that lists DoTS, DoHE, and Monash College Diplomas.

Friction: Information Overload. No "Pathways Calculator" exists to help a student with a 60.00 ATAR choose between the different diploma types.

Step 4: Monash College ATAR Requirements

Finding: User moves to the College-specific page to check entry scores.

Observation: Requirements for Part 1 and Part 2 diplomas are clearly listed by ATAR score.

Step 5: Destination Degrees & Scores

Finding: Table showing the required "Pass" or "Credit" average needed to move into the second year of a degree.

Friction: Navigation Complexity. Extensive "Dropdown" menus make it difficult to compare requirements across different degree options.

Step 6: Application Process

Finding: Instructions for applying through VTAC for the February intake.

Friction: Administrative Ambiguity. No mention of mandatory VTAC application fees, and the Docklands campus location is not prominent until the end of the journey.

Major Friction Points

Site Reliability: 404 errors on high-intent "Pathways" URLs create an immediate sense of distrust.

Navigation Fatigue: "Dropdown hell" in the destination degree section makes it hard to map out a multi-year plan.

Key Information Missing

Total Cost: Exact fee structures for the pathway year are not displayed alongside the course info.

Campus Logistics: Lack of prominence regarding the Docklands location, which may surprise students expecting Clayton or Peninsula.

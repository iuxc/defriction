User A: TAFE Diploma of Nursing Graduate
Persona Profile

Background: TAFE graduate with a Diploma of Nursing.

Goal: Enter the Bachelor of Nursing at Monash University.

Mental Model: "I have a professional qualification; I want to know exactly how much credit I get and how to apply."

Journey Steps & Observations

Step 1: Monash University Homepage

Finding: The search bar is the primary entry point for course information.

Observation: No specific "Pathways" or "TAFE" entry point is visible on the main landing page; navigation assumes a standard starting point.

Step 2: Bachelor of Nursing Course Page

Finding: Page displays the ATAR (76.85) and Monash Guarantee (70) for the 2026 intake.

Friction: The interface is ATAR-centric. A TAFE graduate must scroll past significant high-school-specific data to find the "VET" entry requirements section.

Step 3: VET/TAFE Entry Section

Finding: Notes that entry into the second year is possible with a 75% average and Ahpra registration.

Friction: High use of specialized acronyms (Ahpra, NMBA, VTAC) without inline definitions or tooltips for students coming from a TAFE environment.

Step 4: Credit Search Tool

Finding: User attempts to calculate how many units their specific TAFE Diploma will waive.

Friction: Database Gaps. A search for "Diploma of Nursing" often returns no results for specific regional TAFE providers, leaving the user unable to calculate exact savings.

Step 5: Nursing Pathways Page

Finding: Suggests the Diploma of Tertiary Studies (DoTS) as a primary pathway.

Friction: Conflicting Advice. This page suggests TAFE students should take the DoTS pathway (adding a year), whereas the course page says they can enter Year 2 directly.

Step 6: VTAC Course Search (External)

Finding: User leaves the Monash site to view official application requirements.

Friction: Discovers critical exclusions—such as competency-based assessments without grades not being accepted—that were not stated on the Monash course page.

Major Friction Points

Conflicting Advice: The website contradicts itself on whether a TAFE graduate needs a "Pathways" year (DoTS) or can apply for direct entry.

Credit Dead-ends: The search tool lacks data for common TAFE providers, making it impossible to confirm the "Year 2" entry promise.

Key Information Missing

Specific Unit Credit: No clear list of which units are waived for a standard Diploma of Nursing.

Exclusion Clarity: Lack of early warning regarding "competency-based" (ungraded) TAFE results.

From Gatekeeper to Concierge.

**Subhead:**  
A concept for unifying the admissions journey for 40,000+ applicants.

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM

**Badge:**  
`THE PROBLEM`

**Headline:**  
Admissions by Administrative Burden.

**Body:**  
Applying to Monash as a non-traditional student means navigating 6 to 24 pages across three different websites. Critical information is buried in PDFs, hidden in help documents, and wrapped in acronyms like ATAR, VTAC, AQF, and DoTS.

The result? Students are forced to become detectives—piecing together eligibility requirements, calculating their own scores, and guessing whether they qualify.

**Proof points (keep the "0 Results" and "Hidden +5" cards, but clarify):**

| 0 Results | Hidden +5 |
|-----------|-----------|
| The credit search tool returned no results for a Diploma of Nursing—even from a listed provider. | Equity bonuses for geography and socioeconomic status exist, but students don't know they have them. |

## SECTION 2: THE FRICTION (CONDENSED)

**Badge:**  
`FRICTION LOG`

**Headline:**  
What I found.

**Body:**  
I walked through the current experience as two different users: a TAFE graduate with a Diploma of Nursing, and a Year 12 student with a low ATAR. Both hit dead ends, broken links, and jargon walls.

**Two user cards (keep current format, tighten copy):**

**User A: TAFE Graduate**  
Encountered broken pathways, a credit tool that returned nothing, and conflicting advice between departments.

**User B: Year 12 Pathway**  
Struggled with "dropdown hell," unclear diploma structures, and a surprise campus location revealed only at the end.

## SECTION 3: THE INSIGHT

**Badge:**  
`THE STRATEGIC INSIGHT`

**Headline:**  
The Shift to Equity.

**Body:**  
Australia's University Accord mandates that 80% of the workforce hold tertiary qualifications by 2050. That's 1.8 million more students—most of them first-generation, rural, or low-income.

These are exactly the students who struggle most with the current process. They don't have guidance counselors or parents who've navigated the system. If Monash wants to meet those targets, the website can't be a maze. It has to be a guide.

**Tags:**  
`Equity Focus` `Policy` `Transparency`

## SECTION 4: THE SOLUTION

**Badge:**  
`THE PROPOSED SOLUTION`

**Headline:**  
Visualizing the Invisible.

**Body:**  
Instead of asking students to navigate dozens of pages and calculate their own eligibility, I designed a tool that asks 3–5 questions and shows them exactly where they stand.

The interface displays their score alongside the course requirement—including equity bonuses they didn't know they had. If they're close but not quite there, the tool suggests "bridge" pathways to get them across the line.

**Design decisions (new callout section):**

**Why stacked progress bars?**  
Many students don't know they qualify for geographic or socioeconomic bonuses. The stacked bar reveals hidden points they've already earned—turning confusion into confidence.

**Why stay within Monash's brand?**  
This is a concept, but it had to feel real. I worked within their existing design system to show I can deliver work that fits a client's brand—not just my preferences.

**CTAs:**  
- `Try It Out ↗` → prototype link  
- `View Architecture ↗` → IA documentation

## SECTION 5: VISUAL PROOF

**Headline:**  
Visual Proof

**Subhead:**  
From architectural diagrams to pixel-perfect production.

**Three artifacts (keep current layout):**

| Information Architecture | Low-Fidelity Wireframe | High-Fidelity UI |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| The logic | The structure | The finish |
| `See IA ↗` | `See Wireframe ↗` | `See Demo ↗` |

## SECTION 6: THE PROCESS (NEW)

**Badge:**  
`HOW I WORKED`

**Headline:**  
Weekend Sprint.

**Body:**  
From research to functional prototype: one weekend.

That included learning the Australian higher education system from scratch—ATAR calculations, VTAC processes, equity schemes, pathway structures. No client brief. No hand-holding. Just a problem worth solving.

**Timeline visual (optional):**

| Day 1 | Day 2 |
|-------|-------|
| Research: policy, friction log, user journeys | Design: IA, wireframes, high-fidelity prototype |

---

## SECTION 7: THE IMPACT (REFRAME)

**Badge:**  
`IF THIS SHIPPED`

**Headline:**  
What changes.

**Body:**  
This is a concept, so there are no KPIs. But if Monash built this, here's what I'd expect:

- **For students:** Clarity instead of confusion. Especially for first-gen and rural students without a support network.
- **For Monash:** More qualified applications from equity groups. Fewer drop-offs in the funnel. Progress toward Accord targets.

The current process is a gatekeeper. This turns it into a concierge.

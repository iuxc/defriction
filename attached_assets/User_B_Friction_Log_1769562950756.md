# **User B Friction Log: Year 12 Student with Low ATAR (60.00) Seeking Monash College Pathway**

## **User Profile**

- **Persona**: Year 12 student in Victoria  
- **ATAR**: 60.00 (below typical Monash direct entry requirements)  
- **Goal**: Find a pathway to a Monash University degree via Monash College diploma  
- **Starting Point**: monash.edu homepage  
- **Mental Model**: "I didn't get the ATAR I needed, but I've heard there's a pathway through Monash College"

---

## **Journey Step 1: Starting at Monash University Homepage**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu](https://www.monash.edu) **Timestamp**: Step 1

User B arrives at the Monash homepage, looking for information about alternative pathways for students with lower ATARs.

### **Friction Point 1: Monash College is a SEPARATE WEBSITE**

**URL**: [https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/](https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/) **Observation**: User B must leave monash.edu entirely and navigate to monashcollege.edu.au

The homepage prominently displays:

- "96% of Diplomas students transition to Monash University"  
- "84% of Foundation Year students transition to Monash University"

**Critical Observation**: The website appears to be primarily targeted at INTERNATIONAL students. No clear domestic student pathway visible on homepage.

## **Journey Step 2: Looking for Domestic Student Information**

**URL**: [https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/](https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/) **Timestamp**: Step 2

User B notices the site seems oriented toward international students. Looking for domestic student pathway information.

### **Friction Point 2: 404 Error on Pathways Page**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu/study/how-to-apply/pathways](https://www.monash.edu/study/how-to-apply/pathways) **Result**: PAGE NOT FOUND (Error 404\)

User B attempting to find pathways information encounters a dead end. The logical URL for pathways does not exist.

## **Journey Step 3: Trying to Find Entry Pathways from Monash Study Site**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu/study](https://www.monash.edu/study) **Timestamp**: Step 3

### **Finding: Entry Pathways for Domestic Students Page**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/entry-pathways-domestic](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/entry-pathways-domestic) **Status**: Page exists but was NOT discoverable through intuitive navigation

User B finally found this page through external search. The page lists multiple pathway options:

| Pathway | Description | Target Degrees |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Diploma of Tertiary Studies (DoTS) | Monash University program | Business, Business Admin, Education, Nursing |
| Diploma of Higher Education (DoHE) | Monash University program | Education, Learning Design, Science, Arts |
| Monash Access Program (MAP) | Enabling program for mature-aged | Various |
| **Monash College Diplomas** | Separate institution | Art/Design, Arts, Business, Education, Engineering, IT, Science |
| Single Units | Study 2 units first | Various |
| TAFE qualifications | Certificate IV, Diploma | Various |

**Critical Friction Point**: The page mentions "Monash College Diplomas" but:

1. Links to an EXTERNAL website (monashcollege.edu.au)  
2. Does NOT specify ATAR requirements for domestic students  
3. Does NOT explain the difference between DoTS/DoHE (Monash University) vs Monash College Diplomas

**Confusing Terminology Identified**:

- "DoTS" vs "DoHE" vs "Monash College Diploma" \- Three different diploma pathways with no clear comparison  
- "Enabling program" \- What does this mean?  
- "Graded TAFE qualification" \- What if my TAFE was competency-based?

**PDF Download Identified**: "Download Pathways overview and requirements (PDF, 0.09 MB)"

## **Journey Step 4: Clicking on Monash College Diplomas Link**

**URL**: Following link from entry pathways page **Timestamp**: Step 4

### **Critical Finding: ATAR Requirements for Monash College Diplomas (Australia)**

**URL**: [https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/study/courses/diplomas/entry-requirements](https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/study/courses/diplomas/entry-requirements) **Status**: Found after navigating to EXTERNAL website (monashcollege.edu.au)

**ATAR Requirements Table (Australian Domestic Students):**

| Qualification | Description | Diploma Part 1 | Diploma Part 1A | Diploma Part 2 (Art/Design, Arts Media/Sociology, IT, Science) | Diploma Part 2 (Arts Psychology, Business, Engineering) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| VCE (ATAR) or Australian Year 12 interstate equivalent | Final ATAR score | Successful completion | 55 | 60 | 65 (Business: 62\) |
| Year 11 | Overall average in academic subjects | 60% | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Critical Analysis for User B (ATAR 60.00):**

User B with ATAR 60.00 would be eligible for:

- ✅ Diploma Part 1 (any stream)  
- ✅ Diploma Part 1A (any stream)  
- ✅ Diploma Part 2: Art and Design, Arts (Media/Sociology), IT, Science  
- ❌ Diploma Part 2: Arts (Psychology), Business, Engineering (needs 62-65)

**Friction Points Identified:**

1. **ATAR requirements NOT on Monash University website** \- User B had to navigate to a completely separate website to find this critical information.  
     
2. **Complex Part 1 vs Part 2 structure** \- The distinction between Part 1, Part 1A, and Part 2 is confusing and not clearly explained.  
     
3. **No clear pathway calculator** \- User B cannot easily determine which pathway is best for their ATAR without reading multiple pages.  
     
4. **Missing destination degree information** \- This page doesn't show what degrees each diploma leads to.

## **Journey Step 5: Finding Destination Degrees**

**URL**: Need to find what degrees User B can access after completing diploma **Timestamp**: Step 5

### **Finding: Destination Degrees Entry Requirements (Domestic Students)**

**URL**: [https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/study/courses/diplomas/destination-degrees/destination-degrees-diploma-entry-requirements-domestic](https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/study/courses/diplomas/destination-degrees/destination-degrees-diploma-entry-requirements-domestic)

**Example: Science Faculty Entry Requirements 2026**

| Course | Code | Location | Part 1 (1st year entry) | Part 2 (2nd year entry) | Credit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Bachelor of Applied Data Science | S2010 | Clayton | 70% \+ Higher level maths | 60% \+ Higher level maths | Assessed after completion |
| Bachelor of Applied Data Science Advanced (Honours) | S3003 | Clayton | 80% \+ Higher level maths | 70% \+ Higher level maths | Assessed after completion |
| Bachelor of Science | S2000 | Clayton | 70% \+ Science prerequisite | 55% \+ Science prerequisite | 48 credit points (2-2.5 years) |

**Critical Friction Points:**

1. **DROPDOWN HELL**: User B must click through multiple dropdown menus to find specific degree requirements. There are 6+ dropdowns per year, and multiple years shown.  
     
2. **NO SINGLE VIEW**: Cannot see all degrees and their requirements in one place \- must click through each faculty dropdown individually.  
     
3. **CONFUSING PERCENTAGE SYSTEM**: The "Part 1" and "Part 2" percentages refer to diploma scores, NOT ATAR. This is extremely confusing for a Year 12 student who only knows ATAR.  
     
4. **TWO DIFFERENT SCORING SYSTEMS**:  
     
   - ATAR (60.00) needed to enter the diploma  
   - Diploma percentage (55-80%) needed to enter the degree  
   - These are completely different systems with no conversion guidance.

   

5. **PREREQUISITE COMPLEXITY**: Each degree has different prerequisite subjects (maths, science, etc.) that must be met BEFORE starting the diploma.  
     
6. **ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS**: The page mentions "articulation agreements" with other universities \- confusing jargon.

## **Journey Step 6: Trying to Find How to Apply**

**URL**: Looking for application process **Timestamp**: Step 6

### **Finding: How to Apply as Domestic Student**

**URL**: [https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/study/how-to-apply/domestic-students](https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/study/how-to-apply/domestic-students)

**Application Steps Listed:**

1. Choose your course  
2. Check you meet our entry requirements  
3. Apply through VTAC (Trimester 1 only)  
4. Apply directly  
5. Accept your offer  
6. Prepare to arrive

**Critical Friction Points:**

1. **DUAL APPLICATION PATHWAYS**: User B must choose between:  
     
   - VTAC application (only for Trimester 1\)  
   - Direct application to Monash College

   

   This is confusing \- which is better? Why can't you use VTAC for other trimesters?

   

2. **VTAC vs DIRECT \- NO COMPARISON**: No clear explanation of the differences, advantages, or disadvantages of each pathway.  
     
3. **FEES NOT VISIBLE**: The page mentions "Fees" but doesn't show actual costs. User B would need to navigate to yet another page.  
     
4. **LOCATION SURPRISE**: The page reveals that Monash College is at DOCKLANDS campus \- this is NOT mentioned prominently on the main Monash University website. A student expecting to study at Clayton or Peninsula might be surprised.

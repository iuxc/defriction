Create a new page work/monash.html using the existing design system (style.css) and the following structure:

1. Page Theme & Colors

Theme: "From Gatekeeper to Concierge."

Accent Color: Use Electric Violet (#7C3AED) for data/charts and Volt Lime (#D4FF00) for the primary Prototype Action button.

2. Header Section

Meta: Client: Monash University | Role: Strategy, IA, UI Design.

Headline: From Gatekeeper to Concierge.

Subhead: Unifying 40,000+ pathways into a single "Admissions Engine."

3. Section: The Friction (The Problem)

Headline: The PDF Trap.

Body: "40,000+ applicants were hitting dead ends. Critical pathway data was locked in static PDFs. A TAFE graduate with a Diploma of Nursing would search for credit and get 0 results."

Data Points (Use Space Mono font):

> Dead Ends: 100% fail rate for TAFE searches.

> Hidden Math: Regional students (ATAR 65) unaware of +5 Adjustment Factors.

> Cost: Applicants paying $200 VTAC fees for free direct courses.

4. Section: The Insight (The Strategy)

Headline: Logic over Legacy.

Body: "The 2024 Universities Accord mandates equity access. We couldn't just reskin; we had to expose the logic. We pivoted from 'Am I eligible?' (Gatekeeper) to 'Who are you?' (Concierge)."

Artifact: Display the Logic Flow as a styled code block:

Plaintext
USER INPUT: "I am a TAFE Graduate" -> LOOKUP: ARTICULATION DB -> DIRECT HIT (Green) OR PARTIAL HIT (Amber)
5. Section: The Defriction (The Solution)

Headline: The Pathways Finder.

Body: "We built a dynamic component that visualizes the 'Hidden Math.' It calculates eligibility in real-time."

Visual Feature: Create a CSS-only Bar Chart Animation ("The Stacking Calculator").

Animation: Bar A (Raw ATAR 65, Color: Electric Violet) + Bar B (Regional Bonus +5, Color: Volt Lime) stacks up to meet the Threshold Line (70).

6. Section: The Gallery (Visual Proof)

Layout: 3-Column Grid with hover lift effects.

Image 3: Label: "High-Fidelity UI". Caption: "Production-ready interface." (Placeholder: high_fidelity.png)

7. Section: Prototype Action

Element: Large, full-width Action Button.

Color: Background Volt Lime (#D4FF00), Text Black.

Copy: [ Launch Interactive Prototype ]

Subtext: Experience the "Stacking" animation live in Figma.

8. Section: The Outcome

COMPLIANCE: Centralized logic ensures Accord compliance.

EFFICIENCY: Projected 30% reduction in support tickets.

EQUITY: Surfaces hidden eligibility for regional/low-SES students.

Build a case study page for "Lorbo" using the same template, structure, and components as the Monash University case study page already in this project. The page should follow the exact same layout patterns but with new content and a purple color scheme to match the Lorbo brand.

## Color Scheme
Replace the teal/blue accent color used in Monash with purple (#8B5CF6 or similar — match the Lorbo brand purple from the existing Lorbo website if available in the project).

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section
- Label: "Startup" (small tag above headline)
- Headline: "From Blank Page to Story." (with "Blank Page" in purple accent color)
- Subhead: "An AI journaling companion that turns your daily texts into a narrative — and your year into a book. Research, brand, product, and development. Built solo."
- CTAs: "View the Site →" and "Read the Business Plan ↗"
- Details below CTAs:
  - Project: Lorbo
  - Role: Research, Brand, Product, Development
- Right side abstract wireframe: Create a simplified illustration showing a phone with SMS bubbles (3-4 alternating left/right) with an arrow pointing to a stylized parchment/page with horizontal lines. This represents "texts become story."

### 2. Problem Section
- Label: "The Problem"
- Headline: "Journaling by Willpower." (with "Willpower" in purple accent)
- Body text: "Journaling apps assume the problem is access. Download this app. Open this page. Write something meaningful about your day.

But access was never the problem. The blank page is the problem. The cognitive load of deciding what's worth writing. The guilt of skipping a day, then a week, then abandoning the app entirely.

People download Day One, write for a few days, and stop. They try Apple Journal, get the prompts, and ignore them. They buy the Moleskine, fill three pages, and shelve it.

Meanwhile, those same people text friends all day about the mundane, funny, and meaningful moments of their lives. That content disappears into chat history. Unrecorded."
- Callout stats:
  - "The Pattern:" "Download → Write → Skip → Abandon → Repeat"
  - "The Gap:" "No product captures how people already communicate and turns it into something worth keeping"
- Right side abstract wireframe: A simplified app icon grid (like iPhone home screen) with one app icon highlighted, then faded/ghosted — representing app abandonment.

### 3. Discovery Section
- Label: "What I Found"
- Headline: "Validating the Market."
- Three subsections with body text:
  
  **The StoryWorth Signal**
  "StoryWorth proved that people will pay for 'life → book.' Their model works — prompt-based questions over a year, compiled into a printed book. But it's passive. No character. No narrative transformation. Just prompts and answers."
  
  **The Fantasy Moment**
  "BookTok has driven a cultural surge in fantasy fiction. Cozy fantasy, romantasy, Sarah J. Maas — the audience is large, engaged, and spending. Women 25–45 who read fantasy also overlap heavily with the journaling/wellness market. A niche with disposable income and proven buying behavior."
  
  **The Economics**
  "Unit economics had to work at a $199/year price point. That meant controlling SMS costs (the biggest variable), using a dual-LLM architecture (Haiku for conversation, Sonnet for narrative), and deferring book production until month 10–11 to validate retention first."

- Right side callouts:
  - "TAM:" "AI journaling + memory preservation + AI companionship"
  - "Primary audience:" "Women 25–45, fantasy readers, lapsed journalers"
  - "Competitive white space:" "No product combines SMS input + AI companion + narrative transformation + physical book"
- Right side abstract wireframe: A simplified Venn diagram or matrix showing three overlapping circles (Journaling / Memory Preservation / AI Companion) with Lorbo in the center.

### 4. Insight Section
- Label: "The Reframe"
- Headline: "Not Another App." (with "Another App" in purple accent)
- Body text: "The last thing anyone needs is another app demanding attention. Another icon. Another notification. Another thing to remember to open.

Lorbo isn't an app. It's a text from a friend.

Every night, Lorbo texts you. You tell him about your day — the weird, the wonderful, the completely unremarkable. He listens. He asks questions. He pulls out the details you'd otherwise forget.

Then, while you sleep, a separate system finds the story in your words and writes your journal entry. You wake up to a chapter, not a chore."
- Callout quote: "We don't need more apps. We need things that integrate with our current workflows and life. SMS is where users already are, every day."
- Right side abstract wireframe: Left shows a cluttered grid of app icons. Right shows a single clean SMS conversation thread. Visual contrast between "app overload" and "already there."

### 5. System Section
- Label: "The Character"
- Headline: "A Companion, Not a Chatbot." (with "Chatbot" in purple accent)
- Body text: "If I'm going to tell something about my life every day, it has to feel like it understands me. Generic AI with no personality — 'Pulling calendar events...' — isn't something I want to talk to.

Lorbo is a small, quirky, owl-like creature with an unfinished left wing. He started as part of a story, but was pulled from it before he was complete. Since he has no story of his own, he helps other people write theirs.

He's perceptive, warm when it matters, and never speaks in fantasy clichés. No 'huzzah.' No 'well met.' The fantasy comes from perspective, not vocabulary."

- Subheadline: "Separation of Powers"
- Body text: "Lorbo captures. A separate system crafts.

Lorbo — powered by Claude Haiku — handles the conversation. He asks questions, pulls out details, acknowledges moments. But he never writes a journal entry.

A separate system — powered by Claude Sonnet — reads the conversation and writes the narrative. But it can never update the factbook.

Both systems check every response against a database of characters, settings, and events from the user's life. No message goes out without fact-checking. Because hallucination is subscription death. The moment Lorbo forgets your dog's name, the spell breaks."

- Architecture callouts (styled as a simple diagram or list):
  - "Lorbo (Haiku):" "Conversation, questions, engagement"
  - "Narrative Engine (Sonnet):" "Journal entries, book compilation"
  - "Factbook:" "Characters, settings, events — the source of truth"
  - "Rule:" "Neither system can do the other's job"
- Right side abstract wireframe: A system architecture diagram showing two boxes (Lorbo / Narrative Engine) both connected to a central database icon (Factbook), with flow arrows: User → SMS → Lorbo → Factbook → Narrative Engine → Journal

### 6. Interactive Proof Section (replaces Calculator in Monash)
- Headline: "From Text to Story."
- Subhead: "Every night, a conversation. Every morning, a chapter."
- Component: Side-by-side display
  - Left side: SMS conversation mockup (styled like iPhone messages)

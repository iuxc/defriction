---

## **Journey Step 1: Landing on Monash Homepage**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu](https://www.monash.edu) **Timestamp**: Start of journey

### **Observations:**

- Homepage prominently features "Search courses" search bar  
- No visible "Alternative Pathways" or "TAFE Entry" option  
- Navigation shows: ABOUT | STUDY | RESEARCH | ENTERPRISE | INTERNATIONAL | NEWS & EVENTS  
- "APPLY TO STUDY" button visible in top right  
- No mention of credit transfer or prior learning on homepage

### **Friction Points:**

1. **No pathway-specific entry point** \- User must know to search for the course first  
2. **Homepage assumes traditional entry** \- No visible content for non-traditional students

### **User Action: Will search for "Bachelor of Nursing" or navigate to STUDY section**

---

## **Journey Step 2: Bachelor of Nursing Course Page (Domestic)**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/nursing-m2006?domestic=true](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/nursing-m2006?domestic=true) **Timestamp**: Step 2

### **Observations:**

- Page shows ATAR requirements prominently:  
  - Clayton: 76.85 (Range of criteria)  
  - Monash guarantee for 2026 entry: 70  
  - Lowest ATAR to which an offer was made in 2026: 66.85  
- Subject prerequisites: English ✓, Maths ✓, Sciences/Other: N/A  
- "ATAR & SEAS Calculator" link visible  
- "Monash is committed to admissions transparency" link visible  
- Duration: 3 years (full time), 6 years (part time)  
- Locations: Clayton, Peninsula

### **Critical Friction Points for User A (TAFE Diploma holder):**

1. **ATAR-centric presentation** \- Page assumes user has an ATAR; no mention of TAFE/VET entry  
2. **No visible "Diploma of Nursing" pathway** \- User A cannot see if their qualification is valid  
3. **No credit transfer information visible** \- How much credit would they receive?  
4. **No "Alternative Entry" or "Pathway" section visible** on this page  
5. **Terminology issue**: "RC" superscript on ATAR figures is unexplained jargon

### **User A's Questions Remain Unanswered:**

- Can I enter with my Diploma of Nursing?  
- Will I get credit for my prior learning?  
- How long will my degree take if I already have a Diploma?

### **User Action: Must scroll down or look for "Entry requirements" tab to find pathway info**

## **Journey Step 3: Entry Requirements \- VET/TAFE Section (CRITICAL FINDING)**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/nursing-m2006?domestic=true\#entry-requirements-2](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/nursing-m2006?domestic=true#entry-requirements-2) **Timestamp**: Step 3

### **What User A Finds in the VET/TAFE Section:**

**TAFE/VET:** Only applicants with a graded Diploma of Nursing with at least a minimum of 75% and current registration with Ahpra as an Enrolled Nurse may be eligible for entry.

**Domestic Applicants:** You should apply via VTAC for entry into the Nursing Second Year Diploma entry (Clayton Campus VTAC course code: 2800311841, Peninsula Campus VTAC course code: 2800711841\)

**Bridging course:** (Available to Domestic students only) Monash offers a pathway to Nursing through the one-year, full-time Diploma of Tertiary Studies at the Peninsula Campus only. Applicants seeking entry via this pathway must demonstrate successful completion of all units and at least 55% average over the course.

### **Critical Friction Points Identified:**

1. **Restrictive Entry Requirement**: User A needs 75% minimum grade AND current Ahpra registration as Enrolled Nurse  
     
   - What if User A has 70%? No pathway shown.  
   - What if User A doesn't have Ahpra registration yet? Dead end.

   

2. **Confusing Terminology**:  
     
   - "Ahpra" \- Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (unexplained acronym)  
   - "VTAC course code: 2800311841" \- No explanation of what VTAC is  
   - "Second Year Diploma entry" \- Confusing phrase; does this mean they start in Year 2?

   

3. **Hidden Credit Information**:  
     
   - Page says "Second Year Diploma entry" but doesn't explicitly state: "You will receive 1 year of credit"  
   - No visualization of time saved  
   - No information on which specific units are credited

   

4. **No Link to Credit Details**:  
     
   - No link to see exactly what credit they would receive  
   - No PDF or table showing credit mapping from Diploma of Nursing to Bachelor units

   

5. **Alternative Pathway Buried**:  
     
   - "Diploma of Tertiary Studies" mentioned as bridging course  
   - No link provided to this pathway  
   - Only available at Peninsula Campus \- geographic restriction not highlighted

   

6. **Application Process Unclear**:  
     
   - Must apply via VTAC (external site)  
   - No direct link to VTAC  
   - No explanation of VTAC fees (\~$78-$200)

### **User A's Questions STILL Unanswered:**

- What specific units will I receive credit for?  
- How much money will I save by skipping Year 1?  
- What if my GPA is below 75%?  
- Where do I find the VTAC application?  
- Can I apply directly to Monash for free?

### **Dead End Identified:**

User must now leave Monash site to find VTAC application, with only a course code and no direct link.

## **Journey Step 4: Credit Search Tool \- MAJOR DEAD END**

**URL**: [https://priorstudy.monash.edu/prior-study/](https://priorstudy.monash.edu/prior-study/) **Timestamp**: Step 4

### **What User A Experiences:**

1. **User searches for "Diploma of Nursing" in Australia**  
     
2. **Results show ONLY 1 institution: Victoria University**  
     
   - No other TAFE providers listed (e.g., Holmesglen, Box Hill, RMIT, Chisholm)  
   - This is a CRITICAL gap \- most TAFE nursing diplomas are not in the database

   

3. **When clicking "View my credit" for Victoria University Diploma of Nursing:**

**Eligible credit** "No results were found for this search enquiry. Please try again with different or broader search criteria. A blank result does not indicate ineligibility for credit. An assessment will be made once you have submitted an application."

### **Critical Friction Points:**

1. **DEAD END**: The credit search returns ZERO credit results for Diploma of Nursing  
     
   - User has NO IDEA what credit they will receive  
   - User has NO IDEA how much time/money they will save  
   - User must "submit an application" and WAIT to find out

   

2. **Incomplete Database**: Only Victoria University Diploma of Nursing is listed  
     
   - Major TAFE providers missing (Holmesglen, Box Hill, RMIT, Chisholm, etc.)  
   - User from a different TAFE has no information at all

   

3. **Confusing Disclaimer**:  
     
   - "A blank result does not indicate ineligibility for credit"  
   - This creates uncertainty \- user doesn't know if they're eligible or not

   

4. **No Pathway Guidance**:  
     
   - Tool doesn't connect to the Bachelor of Nursing course page  
   - No mention of "Second Year Diploma entry" pathway  
   - No mention of the 75% GPA requirement

### **User A's Questions STILL Unanswered:**

- Will I get credit for my Diploma of Nursing?  
- How many units/credit points will I receive?  
- Which specific units are credited?  
- How much time will I save (1 year? 6 months?)  
- What if my TAFE isn't Victoria University?

### **Vocabulary Issues:**

- "Eligible credit" vs "Non-eligible credit" \- confusing distinction  
- "Credit Policy" \- links to policy document, not practical guidance

## **Journey Step 5: Nursing Pathways Page \- MISLEADING INFORMATION**

**URL**: [https://www.monash.edu/medicine/nursing/study/undergraduate/discover/pathways](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/nursing/study/undergraduate/discover/pathways) **Timestamp**: Step 5

### **What User A Finds:**

The "Pathways" page for Nursing ONLY discusses the **Diploma of Tertiary Studies (DoTS)** pathway. It does NOT mention the direct TAFE Diploma of Nursing entry pathway at all.

Key content from the page:

"If you're looking for an alternative pathway into the Bachelor of Nursing at Monash, the Diploma of Tertiary Studies (DoTS) could help you get there."

"Offered at Peninsula campus, DoTS provides an entry pathway that is equivalent to the first year of the Bachelor of Nursing if you didn't get the ATAR you expected, or you're looking for a pathway to university as a TAFE graduate or mature-age applicant."

### **Critical Friction Points:**

1. **MISDIRECTION**: This page suggests TAFE graduates should do DoTS (another year of study) rather than directly entering Year 2 of the Bachelor of Nursing with their existing Diploma.  
     
2. **CONFLICTING INFORMATION**: The Bachelor of Nursing course page says TAFE Diploma of Nursing holders can enter directly into "Second Year Diploma entry" with 75% GPA. This Pathways page doesn't mention this option at all.  
     
3. **GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION**: DoTS is only available at Peninsula campus \- not mentioned prominently.  
     
4. **ADDITIONAL YEAR**: DoTS adds a full year before the Bachelor of Nursing, whereas direct entry from Diploma of Nursing would save a year.

### **User A's Confusion:**

A TAFE Diploma of Nursing graduate visiting this "Pathways" page would conclude they need to do DoTS first, which is INCORRECT. They are actually eligible for direct entry into Year 2 of the Bachelor of Nursing (if they meet the 75% GPA and Ahpra requirements).

### **Information Architecture Failure:**

The "Pathways" page is siloed within the School of Nursing website, while the actual TAFE entry information is on the main course page under "Entry Requirements." These two pages contradict each other and create confusion.

## **Journey Step 6: VTAC Course Search \- External Site Required**

**URL**: [https://delta.vtac.edu.au/coursesearch/\#/course/50/2801184](https://delta.vtac.edu.au/coursesearch/#/course/50/2801184) **Timestamp**: Step 6

### **What User A Discovers on VTAC:**

VTAC provides the most complete information about the "Nursing Second Year Diploma Entry" pathway, but User A had to leave the Monash website entirely to find it.

**Key Information Found on VTAC (NOT on Monash site):**

| Requirement | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| Course Name | Nursing Second Year Diploma Entry |
| Course Code (Clayton) | 2800311841 |
| Course Code (Peninsula) | 2800711841 |
| Duration | 2 years minimum |
| Qualification | Bachelor of Nursing |

**VET Applicant Requirements (from VTAC):**

"Only applicants with a completed graded AQF Diploma of Nursing currently eligible for Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia Registration as an Enrolled Nurse, or the Monash Diploma of Tertiary Studies (DoTs) Nursing will be considered for entry into this course."

"Diploma of Nursing applicants should have at least a minimum average of 75% and will need to supply evidence of Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia Registration as an Enrolled Nurse."

"Programs that involve competency-based assessment without grades or marks will not be considered for admission."

### **Critical Friction Points:**

1. **EXTERNAL SITE REQUIRED**: User A must leave Monash.edu entirely and navigate to VTAC to find complete entry requirements.  
     
2. **NO DIRECT LINK**: Monash course page only provides a course code (2800311841) but no clickable link to VTAC.  
     
3. **VTAC APPLICATION FEE**: User A will need to pay VTAC application fee (\~$78-$200) to apply, which is not mentioned on Monash site.  
     
4. **COMPETENCY-BASED EXCLUSION**: VTAC reveals that "Programs that involve competency-based assessment without grades or marks will not be considered" \- this critical exclusion is NOT mentioned on the Monash website.  
     
5. **REGISTRATION TIMING**: VTAC states applicants "will only be eligible for an offer when they supply evidence of their registration as an Enrolled Nurse" \- timing requirement not clear on Monash site.

### **Confusing Vocabulary on VTAC:**

| Term | Meaning | Explanation Provided? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "AQF Diploma" | Australian Qualifications Framework | No |
| "NMBA" | Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia | Partial |
| "Ahpra" | Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency | No |
| "SEAS" | Special Entry Access Scheme | Yes (link provided) |
| "CSP" | Commonwealth Supported Place | No |
| "Inherent requirements" | Physical/cognitive abilities needed | Yes (link provided) |

### **User A's Journey Summary So Far:**

1. Started at monash.edu homepage  
2. Searched "Bachelor of Nursing"  
3. Found course page, scrolled to Entry Requirements  
4. Found VET section with minimal info  
5. Tried Credit Search tool \- NO RESULTS  
6. Found Pathways page \- MISLEADING (suggests DoTS instead)  
7. Had to leave Monash site and go to VTAC  
8. Found complete requirements on VTAC

**Total pages visited: 6+ pages across 2 websites** **Still missing: Specific credit/unit information for Diploma of Nursing**
